 - Stock symbols
 - Twitter timelines
 - Mobile app links
 - MSN Weather forecast
 - Wolfram|Alpha data

 - So much more!
 
In addition, he has many built-in utility functions:

 - Natural language unit conversion
 - Random number generator
 - Discord user profile
 - Server game list
 - Reminders via PM
 - Year countdown
 - Stats for members, games, and commands
 - Even more than this!

And finally, AwesomeBot can conduct **in-chat polls**, offers a fun **live trivia game**, and provides **karma for Discord**.
